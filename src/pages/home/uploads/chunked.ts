/**
 * Session-based chunked upload (large-file friendly):
 * 1. POST /fs/upload/create to create an upload session (may carry MD5 for rapid upload)
 * 2. PUT /fs/upload/part chunk by chunk (each part is an independent request,
 *    real progress is visible, server memory is constant, and it does not hit the
 *    Workers request-body/memory limit)
 * 3. POST /fs/upload/complete to finalize
 * Falls back to stream upload when the storage does not support it.
 *
 * NOTE: This is the Storlane (TSWorker/Workers) upload path. The Go backend
 * uses MultipartUpload instead (see ./multipart.ts). Both are kept; the Go
 * interface and logic are the reference going forward.
